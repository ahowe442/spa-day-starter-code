# Spa Day
This application uses Java and Thymeleaf to 
1. Display the user’s name and skin type under their customer profile.
2. Display the appropriate facial treatments for their skin type.
3. Display the description of the spa’s manicures or pedicures depending on the user’s interest.

This application also allows users to sign up for the spa day app and checks for valid information at login.
